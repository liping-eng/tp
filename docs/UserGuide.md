## 1. Introduction to UniTracker

UniTracker is a one-stop application for NUS students to keep track of their work in school. This
product is optimal for students who prefer Command Line Interface (CLI) over Graphical User
Interface (GUI).

### 1.1 About UniTracker

UniTracker consists of 4 key features (refer to [Section 3. Features](#3-features)) that helps to
organise all the information they need in one place. You can add and edit module information, tasks,
zoom links to suit their needs.

### 1.2 About This User Guide

This user guide was made to help you set up UniTracker on your computer and also provide you with
all the information you need to use UniTracker. It clearly documents the features UniTracker offers
with examples to aid you in familiarising yourself with UniTracker.

### 1.3 How to Use This User Guide

Firstly, refer to [Section 2. Quick Start](#2-quick-start) for instructions on setting up UniTracker
on your local computer.

Once UniTracker is up and running, you can refer to the [table of contents](#table-of-contents) to
navigate to specific sections to explore, learn and use UniTracker.

### 1.4 Conventions in This User Guide

In this developer guide, all text that appears on the CLI or in code will be written in a `code block`.

In the example code for each feature, all user inputs will start with an angle bracket.
E.g. `> user input`
> **Note!**  
> This is a note section. Additional useful information will be written in sections such as this one.

> **<span style="color: red"> WARNING! </span>**   
> This is a warning section. Any user interaction with UniTracker that may result in issues or unintended results will be written in sections such as this one.

Welcome to CAP Simulator!
Note: CAP Simulated takes your current CAP and total number of MCs taken into account.
If you intend to calculate your CAP solely on new entries, 
please go back to the HelpGraduation menu and set existing CAP and MCs taken to be 0.

Key in 1 to simulate your cap base on the grades you have entered before for each module.
Key in 2 to simulate cap base on your own input.
